description: Analyze a provider's APIs for Social Login or SSO

Please review the API provided by $ARGUMENTS, focusing on the login, oAuth, or
SSO system used. We want to be able to authenticate the user without a backend
server if possible, but if we need an API, it will be written in PHP, so check
for libraries or SDKs.

Please write your findings to @research/$ARGUMENTS-api.md
