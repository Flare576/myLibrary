description: Analyze a provider's APIs for Social Login or SSO

Please review the API provided by $ARGUMENTS, focusing on the login, oAuth, or
SSO system used. After authentication, we need to be able to get a list of the
user's available games. The server-side integration will need to be written in
PHP, so check for libraries or SDKs.

Please write your findings to @research/$ARGUMENTS-api.md
